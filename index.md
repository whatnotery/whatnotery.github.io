After coding on and off since I was a teenanger I spent the better part of a decade doing I.T. support at an enterprise level. During that time I encountered so many problems that could've been resolved with better code. Being in the situation of helping people navigate through bad user experiences and using lack luster internal tools to do so left a bad taste in my mouth and made me want to solve those problems.

In 2021, I started coding seriously with the intention of being able to create tools and experiences that are useful and meaningful for their users. I started at Bitwerx in 2022 as a Support Engineer role and in 2023 was promoted to a Software Engineering role.
