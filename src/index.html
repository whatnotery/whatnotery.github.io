  <h3>About Me:</h3>

  <p>After coding on and off since I was a teenanger I spent the
    better
    part of a decade doing I.T. support at an enterprise level.
    During that time I encountered so many problems that could've been
    resolved with better code. Being in the situation of helping
    people navigate through bad user experiences and using lack luster
    internal tools to do so left a bad taste in my mouth and
    made me want to solve <i>those</i> problems.</p>
  <p>In 2021, I started coding seriously with the intention of being
    able to create tools and experiences that are useful and
    meaningful for their users. I'm still learning at this point but
    some of the languages, skills, and technologies I've learned
    and am interested in at this point are below:</p>
