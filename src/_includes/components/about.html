  <h3>About Me:</h3>

  <p>After coding on and off since I was a teenanger I spent the
    better
    part of a decade doing I.T. support at an enterprise level.
    During that time I encountered so many problems that could've been
    resolved with better code. Being in the situation of helping
    people navigate through bad user experiences and using lack luster
    internal tools to do so left a bad taste in my mouth and
    made me want to solve <i>those</i> problems.</p>
  <p>In 2021, I started coding seriously with the intention of being able to create tools 
    and experiences that are useful and meaningful for their users. 
    At the beginning of 2022 I started work as a technical operations specialist 
    and over the course of several months moved into doing full stack development with Ruby on Rails</p>
