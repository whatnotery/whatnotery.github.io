As a driven problem-solver and creative, I gravitated towards computers and programming beginning in my teenage years — I remember the joy I felt opening my first local HTML file of a simple `<h1>` and `<p>` tag and later writing small extensions for open-source software to automate repetitive tasks. After working in Enterprise IT for nearly decade I pivoted to software engineering where I developed my skills in **Ruby** and **JavaScript** leading me to take on contract work as a developer and a full-time position as a support engineer. In less than six months, I started development work at the company and was later promoted to a development role. In this time, I’ve refined my skills with **Ruby on Rails**, testing with **RSpec** and **Capybara**, frontend development with **Svelte**, and even a little bit of **C#**.

When I’m not coding, I find joy in being outside (walking, hiking, or cycling), listening to my [record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/whatnotery), drinking natural wines, spending time with my partner, and serving on the board of directors of my [local bike co-op.](https://www.thebrokespoke.org/)
